## Community roles

Besides being the users of Zadig, which is a great way of contributing to the community by itself (and thank you!), there are 3 active community roles:
- Contributor
- Maintainer
- Council member

Note that the latter role is built on top of the former -- i.e. A council member is also a maintainer and a contributor, a maintainer is a contributor as well. Please see the following table for their primary responsibilities:
| Role           | Primary responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## How to become a contributor?
Anyone can be recognized as a Zadig contributor, as long as they manage to have one PR accepted, answered questions in the community forum, or simply reported an issue.

## How to become a maintainer?
Must be a contributor first, and nominated by an existing maintainer or a council member.
The council will make a decision for the nomination. Normally both the technical and community contribution will be taken into consideration. For example, these are strong signals if the candidate has been a productive contributor, played a key role in driving a few designs, demonstrated both technical skills and enthusiasm towards the project, and been a great citizen for the community.

## How to become a council member?
The candidate has to be a maintainer first and be nominated by 2 council members.
The council will make a decision for the nomination. The candidate has to have demonstrated strategic impact on the project over a relatively long horizon (or in a consistent way), for example,
- Initiated a series of key designs and successfully drove them to be landed
- Having a positive impact over the community such as constantly guiding new members, or consistently answering questions
- Successfully driving the project to be much more impactful and modeling deep understanding in the product and the industry
